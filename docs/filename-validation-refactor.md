# Filename Validation Refactor: Developer Notes

## Overview
This document summarizes the recent refactor of the filename validation logic in the Validator application. The goal was to unify, robustly test, and clarify the handling of complex filename patterns, token definitions, and error reporting, ensuring alignment between production logic and test expectations.

## Key Changes

- **Unified Validation Logic:**
  - The core methods `_basic_filename_validation` and `_validate_by_tokens` were refactored to use robust, unit-tested logic derived from `MockValidator`.
  - The validator now uses token definitions from YAML (e.g., `Sphere.yaml`) for detailed, stepwise validation.

- **Regex and Token Alignment:**
  - The regex pattern and token-by-token logic were synchronized to ensure that all valid filenames pass and all invalid formats are caught.
  - The negative lookahead (which previously blocked valid filenames with a dot before frame padding) was removed from all patterns.

- **Separator Handling:**
  - Separator logic was improved: missing separators (such as `_` between department and task) are now clearly detected and reported with actionable error messages. Error messages now explicitly include the missing separator character (e.g., `Missing separator '_' between department and task`) for clarity.

- **Error Reporting:**
  - All error messages are now actionable and user-friendly, both in the UI and logs.
  - Errors specify the exact token or separator that failed, and the expected format. Separator errors always name the missing separator character for user clarity.

- **Testing:**
  - All unit tests in `tests/test_filename_validation.py` were updated for alignment with the new logic, including explicit separator character reporting in error messages.
  - Only genuine validation logic errors remain as failures; all integration and separator issues are resolved.

## Developer Guidance

- **Adding/Modifying Tokens:**
  - Edit `Sphere.yaml` (or your rules YAML) to adjust token order, types, or separators.
  - Ensure that each token's `regex` and `separator` fields are consistent with the filename template.

- **Debugging Failures:**
  - If a test fails, check the error message for the specific token or separator involved.
  - Confirm that both the regex and token definitions match the intended filename format.

- **Extending Validation:**
  - Add new test cases to `tests/test_filename_validation.py` for any new patterns or edge cases.
  - Use the `MockValidator` as a reference for expected validation behavior.

## Migration/Upgrade Notes
- Remove any old debug files and logging code left over from the refactor.
- Review and update any custom UI or integration code that consumes validation errors, as error formats may have changed.

## Contacts
- For further help, contact the Validator maintainers or refer to the in-code docstrings for `_basic_filename_validation` and `_validate_by_tokens`.
