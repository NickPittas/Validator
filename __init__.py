# Validator/__init__.py
# This file's presence in a directory added to Nuke's plugin path (e.g., ~/.nuke/Validator/)
# allows Nuke to recognize and load modules from this directory.
#
# The actual 'Validator' module alias and its 'launch_validator_for_nuke' function
# are provided by 'main_window.py', which registers itself in sys.modules.
